Refers to file: fiboSteps.c

HOW to compile fiboSteps.c (on flip):

gcc -o fiboSteps fiboSteps.c

This program requires one command line argument:
    an integer representing the number of risers in a staircase.  
    The integer should be postive and less than 92.  
    Staircases with 92 or more risers cannot be calculated because
        the result is greater than the maximum integer that can be represented.  
    Output is written to terminal.  

HOW to run the code: 

./fiboSteps 13

OR

./fiboSteps 82

OR

./fiboSteps (with whatever staircase size you want)

This will work perfectly.
